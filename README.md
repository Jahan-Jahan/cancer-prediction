# Cancer Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on data preprocessing and machine learning techniques for predicting cancer. The goal is to provide a structured and educational approach to working with a cancer dataset, covering data visualization, feature engineering, and various machine learning models.

## Sections

### Data Processing
- **[Visualization](#pca-visualization)**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization using PCA.
- **[Preprocessing](#preprocessing)**: Handling missing values, normalization, and other preprocessing techniques.
- **[Feature Engineering](#feature-engineering)**: Creating new features or selecting the most relevant ones.

### Training
- **[Logistic Regression](#logistic-regression)**: A simple yet effective linear model.
- **[Random Forest](#random-forest)**: Ensemble learning with decision trees.
- **[Support Vector Machine](#support-vector-machine)**: A robust classification algorithm.
- **[Neural Network](#neural-network)**: Deep learning approach for classification.
- **[Customized AdaBoost](#adaboost)**: A manually implemented AdaBoost model.
- **[Sklearn-AdaBoost](#sklearn-adaboost)**: Using Scikit-Learn's built-in AdaBoost.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage
Run the notebook step by step to preprocess data and train models:
```bash
jupyter notebook cancer_prediction.ipynb
```

## Contributions
This project is intended for learning purposes, and contributions are welcome! Feel free to improve the models, enhance visualizations, or add new preprocessing techniques.

## License
This project is open-source and available for anyone to learn from and build upon.
